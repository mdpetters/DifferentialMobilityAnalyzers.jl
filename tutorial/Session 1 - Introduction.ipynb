    "__Abstract__. Many aerosol measurement techniques produce raw measurement response functions that must be inverted to properly interpret the data. This tutorial will introduce common inversion approaches used in Aerosol Science & Technology. One often used technique is mobility classification of aerosol using electrical mobility analyzers. The tutorial will briefly introduce the aerosol sampling with mobility analyzers and provide hands-on examples for several instrument configurations. The examples are designed to demonstrate how the inversion of mobility analyzer response functions is critical to informing experimental design and data analysis. At the end of the session, tutorial participants will have a starting point to modify supplied computer code for use in their own research projects.\n",
