# Overview

The manual shows how to setup problems and includes several examples. The examples in the manual are abbreviated to focus on the key code elements. For example, commands used for plotting the results are ommitted. The complete examples are provided in the ```examples/``` directory. 


## Examples
You can run these examples through the REPL. [Download](https://github.com/mdpetters/DifferentialMobilityAnalyzers.jl/archive/master.zip) the files from GitHub. Extract the files. Start a shell and navitgate to the folder ```DifferentialMobilityAnalyzers.jl/examples/```. Start the Julia REPS with the --project flag:

```bash
julia --project
```

Then run one of the examples from the REPL prompt.

```julia
julia> include("tranmsission.jl")
```

The plots will show up in the browser.

## Further Information
The manual sections link to the reference for details. At each junction, the manual will provide appropriate reference to one of the [Tutorial](@ref) Sessions, [Notebooks](@ref), and/or Figure in the [Manuscript](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2018.1530724).
