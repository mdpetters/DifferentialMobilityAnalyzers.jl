# DifferentialMobilityAnalyzers.jl

*A Julia package for working with data from differential mobility analyzers.*

DifferentialMobilityAnalyzers.jl bundles a set of abstractions to write concise forward and inverse models of experimental setups that involve  differential mobility analyzers. Abstractions include specialized data types, operators, functions, and conventions. 
Conventions include rules for typesetting font and sub- and superscripting variables.
