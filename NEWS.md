---
## v2.5
- Add memoization of slow functions (setupSMPS, setupDMA, setupSMPSdata, and 
initializeDefaultMatrices). This speeds up code when called with the same input parameters.
- Remove most global variables in dmafunctions; the globals resulted in sometimes
inconsistent results when multiple DMAs were initialized in the same script. 
- One global variable remains in the code for compatibility reasons, otherwise the code should be pure 
- Memoization means that rinv(R, Œ¥) has no longer a performanc penalty when called multiple times with the same DMA Œ¥. This makes the method rinv2(R) unnecessary and it is removed.  
- Removal of globals required moving the function Œ©‚Çê·µ• into setupSMPS, due to a previous implicit
dependence on a global. Reference to this function in the docs is removed.

## v2.4
- Update documentation for rinv2 and add logo
- Merged CompatHelper: bump compat for "Interpolations" to "0.13
- Add rinv2 function based on RegularizationTools.jl. Intended to supersede rinv and supports higher order inversions and performance gains.
- Revisions related to the addition of rinv2
- Thinned out Project.toml and added Compat section.

## v2.3
- Various small bugfixes discovered during documentation.
- Add benchmark scripts to track performance across CPU architectures and over time.
- Add self-contained examples folder with code that matches the docs.
- Add docstrings and write Documenter.jl documentation for the package.
- Add links to Docker container with precompiles sys image.
- Add links to narrated tutorial notes to manual.
- Add interpolateSizeDistributionOntoŒ¥ function. This is match grids for chained DMA systems.
- Add recommendation for MKL library for additional performance gain
- Signficant speedup in inversion by switching to Choleskey decomposition for computing the inverse
- Revise search functions for performance gain.
- Limit number of BLAS threads to 1 for factor 4 speedup in inversion.

## v2.2
- Add interpolateDataFrameOntoŒ¥ function. This is used to convert a  measured size distribution stored as a DataFrame and to a SizeDistribution that matches a DMA grid. The function simplifies using the package with real data.
- Preallocate identity matrix
- Fix performance regression caused by changes in 2.1
- Add subtraction operator: ùïü1 - ùïü2
- Remove Plots.jl/PlotlyJS.jl/ORCA.jl dependencies for core project. The packages are still needed for executing the notebooks but they don't need to be installed when the package is embedded for regular use and carry a lot of overhead.

## 2.1
- Fix deprecation warnings from DataFrames API
- Use generic types: AbstractFloat, Vector{<:AbstractFloat} and AbstractMatrix. This fixes an error for  ùêÄ * ùïü if ùêÄ is of Adjoint type, the default output of Eq. 8 in the paper.
- Ensure symmetry to size distribution arithmetic, i.e. ùêÄ * ùïü == ùïü * ùêÄ; a * ùïü == ùïü * a; T * ùïü == ùïü * T; a ‚ãÖ ùïü == ùïü ‚ãÖ a. 
- Update packages and tests to be compatible with Julia 1.5

## 2.0
- Fix deprecations to be compatible with Julia 1 series.
- Switch all Jupyter documentation graphs from javascript to svg. 
- Remove broadcasting . operator for all operations with size distributions (ùïü * ùïü instead of ùïü .* ùïü and EF ‚ãÖ ùïü instead of EF .‚ãÖ ùïü). 
- Designate DMA geometry :cylindrical or :radial in DMAconfig   

## 1.0.0
- Version released with the manuscript
