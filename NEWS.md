#### Notes on release changes and ongoing development
- v2.1 supports Julia 1.5
- v2.0 supports Julia 1.1
- Version 1.0.0 is the last one to support Julia 0.6.4

---
## current master
- Limit number of BLAS threads to 1 for factor 4 speedup in inversion.

## v2.2
- Add interpolateDataFrameOntoŒ¥ function. This is used to convert a  measured size distribution stored as a DataFrame and to a SizeDistribution that matches a DMA grid. The function simplifies using the package with real data.
- Preallocate identity matrix
- Fix performance regression caused by changes in 2.1
- Add subtraction operator: ùïü1 - ùïü2
- Remove Plots.jl/PlotlyJS.jl/ORCA.jl dependencies for core project. The packages are still needed for executing the notebooks but they don't need to be installed when the package is embedded for regular use and carry a lot of overhead.

## 2.1
- Fix deprecation warnings from DataFrames API
- Use generic types: AbstractFloat, Vector{<:AbstractFloat} and AbstractMatrix. This fixes an error for  ùêÄ * ùïü if ùêÄ is of Adjoint type, the default output of Eq. 8 in the paper.
- Ensure symmetry to size distribution arithmetic, i.e. ùêÄ * ùïü == ùïü * ùêÄ; a * ùïü == ùïü * a; T * ùïü == ùïü * T; a ‚ãÖ ùïü == ùïü ‚ãÖ a. 
- Update packages and tests to be compatible with Julia 1.5

## 2.0
- Fix deprecations to be compatible with Julia 1 series.
- Switch all Jupyter documentation graphs from javascript to svg. 
- Remove broadcasting . operator for all operations with size distributions (ùïü * ùïü instead of ùïü .* ùïü and EF ‚ãÖ ùïü instead of EF .‚ãÖ ùïü). 
- Designate DMA geometry :cylindrical or :radial in DMAconfig   

## 1.0.0
- Version released with the manuscript
